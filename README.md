# Amazon Sales Dashboard
The Amazon Sales Dashboard is a comprehensive visualization tool designed to provide insights into the sales performance of products on the Amazon platform. It leverages data analytics and visualization techniques to present key metrics and trends in a user-friendly interface. This dashboard is particularly useful for sellers and business owners who want to track and analyze their sales data effectively.

## This dashboard provides three distinct information pages for easy navigation:

   ### Sales Performance:
   This page provides a quick overview of your recent sales activity on Amazon Seller Central, including order status 
   (cancelled, pending, shipped), sales volume, average customer reviews, and sales trends over time.

   ### Product Listing Page: 
   This page displays a list of Sarees available for purchase, likely on Amazon. It showcases key information about each 
   Saree, such as name, price (including any discounts), availability, customer ratings, and number of reviews.

   ### Product View Page:
   This page focuses on a single product, a women's kurta in this case. It allows sellers (presumably you) to manage details 
   like pricing, inventory, and fulfillment options. Customers can view product information, including brand, category, and 
   shipping details, but this particular kurta seems to be out of stock and lacks a description.
